👋 Hey there, I’m Rahul Joshi

Welcome to my corner of GitHub — where code, curiosity, and caffeine meet. ☕💻

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate, Backend & ML enthusiast, and someone who genuinely enjoys turning ideas into scalable, real-world systems. From building APIs to training ML models and experimenting with RAG pipelines — I love getting my hands dirty with tech that actually works in production.
