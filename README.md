👋 Hey there, I’m Rahul

A Computer Science undergraduate, Backend & ML enthusiast, and someone who genuinely enjoys turning ideas into scalable, real-world systems. From building APIs to training ML models and experimenting with RAG pipelines — I love getting my hands dirty with tech that actually works in production.

I believe in learning by building. Tutorials are cool, but shipping projects is cooler.
